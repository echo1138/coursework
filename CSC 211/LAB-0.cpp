//*  Write a program that allows the user to enter five numbers and *
//*  then computes and displays BOTH the sum and product in the     *
//*  exact format as illustrated in the example below.              *
//*                                                                 *
//*  EXAMPLE:  If the user entered 2 3 100 10 5                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*            then the output would be                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*              120 = 2 + 3 + 100 + 10 + 5                         *
//*              30000 = 2 X 3 X 100 X 10 X 5                       *
